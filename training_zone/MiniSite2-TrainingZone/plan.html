  <h1> Project Plan</h1>
  <h1> Mini Site 2 - Training Zone</h1>
  <p>&lt;Name: Samantha Yeo &amp; Login: JC437402&gt; </p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>The project is to increase revenue for Training Zone and attract more and repeating customers to join in. And, also to bring in more sales for the Training Zone.<br>
  Customers will be curious into finding more about the Training Zone upon coming to the first page of the website. With more curious customers, they will be eager to find out more about the Training Zone and how the Training Zone will benefit themselves.</p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>To show that there is an increase in the number of people signing up for Training Zone within 3 months, we will compare the sales between with the new website and without the new website. <!--How do you know that the site does what the client wanted? Measure the mission.--></p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>My site is intended for customers who are aged between 28 and 50 years old. Those who are currently looking for a job are all welcomed to sign up for the Training Zone.</p>
